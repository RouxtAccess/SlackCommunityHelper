## Slack Community Helper

This is a Slack app which helps manage your slack workspace better.

It's specifically designed with communities in mind and has a lot of helpful tools which Slack isn't keen to build.

It's hosted over here: https://communitybot.rouxtaccess.com/ 

But if you'd rather you data never leave your workspace and you'd prefer to self-host, feel free to go wild!
